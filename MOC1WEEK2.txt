Develop your professional networks
Think real-time
Develop a holistic view of social
Social networks have shallow, quick conversations on a topic, whereas virtual communities have deeper and more long-term discussions of a topic.
Only add sites when they are popular to your target audiences.
Classify sites by their function.
Focus only on sites containing your high-value markets.
They are influencers who have significant numbers of followers, and one positive mention from them will impact the people you want to attract.
