Social networks are created to link members together as families, friends or colleagues to allow for conversation and the exchange of pictures.
The creators of social networks are entrepreneurs who want to eventually monetize their site.
Many social networks start by focusing on communication. Then, after they grow, they add some type of revenue generation device like advertisements to raise revenues.
Conversations are deep and focused on subjects of interest to the members.
Most virtual communities are created by members who also manage them.
Virtual community members want to address their needs to express their passions or address a life event.
Influencers connect community experts with community members to spread key information throughout the community.
Passion communities address an internal need of ours, and we seek them because we want to.
These communities are on a mission and want to hear from experts who have the solutions they need.
We need to encourage peer-to-peer discussions to let members talk to each other about trends and important topics.
Passion communities are always seeking the newest trends, so we will need to keep up to remain relevant to our members.
